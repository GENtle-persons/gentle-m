GENtle install hints

COMMON:

Good luck! You'll need it...

WINDOWS:

You can use Dev-C++ as development environment. ".dev" files are
included in the source. You'll need the latest wxWindows package (look
on the wxWindows site rather than the Dev-C++ site).

LINUX:
Install wxGTK. Within there, create a subdirectory (e.g, "Mine"). In
there, you checkout the cvs (e.g., in "GENtle").
