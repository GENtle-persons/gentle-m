GENtle install hints

MAC OS:

This software was initially developed for the macOS, at a time when the
PowerPC was a thing, still. We recently had success with Xcode, but that
requires much tinkering to adapt to local install paths of the build-dependencies.
We find it much easier to work with conda or homebrew (https://brew.sh).
For details, see the respective description of homebrew/conda below
in the Linux section.

The application runs fine when started in situ directly after the compilation.
To facilitate the deployment on macOS, we are providing the target "macos_bundle"
that, with the help of the additional package "dylibbundler" (provided by homebrew),
assembles a folder named "GENtle.app" that can be copied as it is into the
"Applications" folder on any Mac of the same architecture for a complete deployment.

LINUX:

The Linux OS offers several routes to install GENtle:

 * Your Distributions's Package manager
   We are working closely with the Debian Linux distribution, try
   "sudo apt install gentle". The state of the packaging can be
   inspected on https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gentle

 * Conda
   We have also provided a package for conda, add their channel
   "bioconda" and try
   "conda install gentle"

To build your package from source, try

 * Debian:
   - Installation of build-dependencies
     "sudo apt builddep gentle"
   - ./autogen.sh
   - ./configure
   - ./make -j10

 * conda:
   See the recipe on
   https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/gentle

 * homebrew:
   We do not yet have a maintainer for homebrew but found it straight-forward to compile :
   - Installation of dependencies:
     brew install wxwidgets tinyxml automake autoconf
   - ./autogen.sh
   - CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/include" ./configure
   - make -j10

Upon successful compilation, the executable "GENtle" can be started in the "src" folder.

WINDOWS:

We would welcome volunteers to step forward for whom Windows is their
regular development environment to help with providing executables for
that platform.

From what we remember:
You can use Dev-C++ as development environment. ".dev" files are
included in the source. You'll need the latest wxWindows package (look
on the wxWindows site rather than the Dev-C++ site).

You do not want to wait for an official Windows release:
GENtle works nicely with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This
is surprisingly easy to install. If installing only for GENtle, use
Debian testing (bookworm) and install the regular Debian package.
