GENtle install hints

COMMON:

Good luck! You'll need it...

WINDOWS:

We would welcome volunteers to step forward for whom Windows is their
regular development environment to help with providing executables for
that platform.

From what we remember:
You can use Dev-C++ as development environment. ".dev" files are
included in the source. You'll need the latest wxWindows package (look
on the wxWindows site rather than the Dev-C++ site).

MAC:

This software was initially developed for the MacOS, at a time when the
PowerPC was a thing, still. We recently had success with Xcode, but that
requires much tinkering to adapt to local install paths of the
build-dependencies. For now, we find it much easier to work with conda or
homebrew as described for Linux.

LINUX:

The Linux OS offers several routes to install GENtle:

 * Your Distributions's Package manager
   We are working closely with the Debian Linux distribution, try
   "sudo apt install gentle"

 * Conda
   We have also provided a package for conda, add their channel
   "bioconda" and try
   "conda install gentle"

To build your package from source, try

 * Debian:
   - Installation of build-dependencies
     "sudo apt builddep gentle"
   - ./autogen.sh
   - ./configure
   - ./make -j10

 * conda:
   See the recipe on
   https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/gentle

 * homebrew:
   We do not yet have a maintainer for homebrew but found it straight-forward to compile :
   - Installation of dependencies:
     brew install wxwidgets tinyxml automake autoconf
   - ./autogen.sh
   - CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/include" ./configure
   - make -j10

Upon successful compilation, the executable "GENtle" can be started in situ.
