<h1>Ligation</h1>
Ligation is the next step after <a href="en_restriction.htm">restriction</a>.
Through the menu "Tools/Ligation" or "Ctrl-L", the ligation dialog can be invoked.

<p>Its left list show all currently loaded <i>linear</i> DNA sequences.
Only the tagged sequences will be used for ligation.
By default, all sequences with sticky ends are tagged. For blunt end ligations,
sequences have to be selected manually.

<p>The right list shows all products that can result from a ligation. "Poly-ligations" ("A-B-A-B-A-B-...")
are <i>not</i> generated. For circular products, all logical products (e.g., "A-B" and "B-A") are shown;
both are, in effect, identical, and only one of them should be tagged.

<p>Through the "Ligate!" button, the tagged products in the right list are generated.
Their names are created from the ligated sequences, and a description of the ligation is generated.
Both names and descriptions may have to be edited manually afterwards.
