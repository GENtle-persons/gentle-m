<h1>Alignments</h1>
<center><font color=red>Attention! This functionality has not been fully implemented yet!</font></center>

<p>In the Alignment representation several sequences can be compared (currently a maximum
of two) and insertions, deletions and mismatches are automatically indicated.

<p>In the settings dialog, which can be invoked through "Tools/Alignment" or "Ctrl-G", the sequences to align and the alignment algorithm can be chosen:
<ul>
<li><b>Smit-Waterman</b> for local alignments (e.g., a short sequence to be aligned to a long one)</li>
<li><b>Needleman-Wunsch</b> for global alignments (e.g., two sequences of similar length)</li>
</ul>
<p>For longer sequences, and on slow computers, the alignment algorithm can take several minutes to calculate an alignment!
