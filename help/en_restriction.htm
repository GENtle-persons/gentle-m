<h1>Restriction</h1>
The (simulated) restriction of a DNA sequence is a two-step process.
First, all needed enzymes are added to a virtual "cocktail".
In the second step, the restriction is started, resultion is the respective DNA fragments.
The fragments are named by the original sequence and the restriction enzymes used.
The fragment description shows the details of the respective restriction.

<h2>Restriction through context menu</h2>
Richt-clicking on a restriction site in the plasmid map opens a context menu,
containing "Add to cocktail" and "Add to cocktail and cut". Enzymes that are
already in the cocktail are shown at the bottom of the context menu, as well as
a "Cut with cocktail" function.

<h2>Restriction assistent</h2>
<p>The restriction assistent is invoked via the "Tools" menu, or by clicking on a
restriction site in the plasmid map with the middle mouse button.

<p>The left side of the restriction assistent shows enzymes that can be added to the cocktail.
This display can be altered by choosing a different group or a "cutting filter".
The list can be sorted by enzyme name or number of cuts.

<p>The fragments that would result from a cur with a <i>selected</i> enzyme are shown
at the bottom of the left side of the dialog. A selected enzyme can be added to the cocktail through
the "cocktail" button.

<p>The right side contains the list of enzymes already in the cocktail. The resulting
fragments of a restriction with <i>all</i> enzymes in the cocktail are shown at the bottom
of the right side of the dialog. Enzymes can be removed from the cocktail through
the appropriate button.

<p>To ignore small DNA fragments, a minimum fragment size can be set.

<p>Canceling the dialog will discard all changes that were made. Finishing the
dialog will keep the changes, but <i>not</i> start the restriction yet. To start
the restriction, click on the "scissors" button.
