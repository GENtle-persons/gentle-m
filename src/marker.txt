# This file contains DNA markers for virtual gels
# You can add your own in the following form:
# Name:bp:conc,bp:conc,bp:conc,bp:conc,bp:conc ...
# *Name is the name of the marker
# *bp is the number of base pairs in that band
# *conc is the concentration of that DNA in the marker (ng/Âµl)
# ":conc" can be omitted. The default concentration (20) is then used
#
# NOTE: If you enter new data here, it will probably be replaced on the next GENtle update.
#       To prevent this, either mark this file read-only, or enter the new marker at
#       http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GENtle/DNA_markers
