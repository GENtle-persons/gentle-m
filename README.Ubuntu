To compile on Ubuntu (tested on Hairy Hadron, or something),
sudo apt-get install the following packages:
libwxgtk2.8-dev
automake1.9
libmysql++-dev
libsqlite0-dev
libsqlite3-dev

Then the usual
./configure
make

Done!

If anyone could make a decent package from GENtle, or better help me make one,
it would be much appreciated.
