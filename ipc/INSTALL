The easy way:
-------------

turn into root and place the sources into /usr/local/ipc-1.1

$ cd ipc-1.1
$ ./configure
$ make all
$ make install


The not so easy way:
--------------------

When installing ipc there are two points to take care of:

1:  The file "elemente":
----------------------

ipc expects its sources to be placed in /usr/local/ipc-1.1 and this is 
where it exepects the file elemete too.

When installing into an other directory you must give configure the 
directory via --prefix otherwise ipc won´t find this file and therefore not 
recognize any chemical symbol.
After the installation all files may be removed except the file "elemente"

So if you want ipc in your home directory you should do something like:

$ cd ~
$ tar -xzf ipc-1.1.tar.gz"
$ cd ipc-1.1
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/<your_username>
$ make

This will produce an executable ipc in the directory
/home/<username>/ipc-1.1 which will need the file 
/home/<your_username>/ipc-1.1/elemente 
in order to work.

2: ipc and GNUPlot
------------------

ipc can produce output which is suitable for GNUPlot. When producing gnuplot
output GNUPlot is also called to show the data. 
If you don´t like this or if gnuplot is not available on your system you 
can give configure --enable-NO_GNUPLOT
The -g optin will still work but ipc will not try to call GNUPLot afterwards.
Try ./configure --help for details on configure
